-----CI-----
download code ----> linting ----> build ----> unit test ----> sca(software compliance analysis) ----> SAST ----> Dockerize            ----> Testing ----> push image into artifact repository
                                                                                                                (create docker images)

sca - libraries of different packages, known for vulnerablities.

vulnerablities - place within the code which can be misused by hackers.


-----CD(Continuous delivery)-----
Artifactory ----> SIT ----> Performance Testing ----> Security Testing 
                   |                                    (DAST)
                   deploy
                   |
                   test (automated)
SIT - System Integration Testing - end to end testing
DAST - Dynamic analysis security testing

Artifact is :
-> zip
-> jar/war for java
-> gems for ruby
-> exe/iso for .net
-> docker images

there are approximately 200 types of artifacts.

----Continuous Deployment----
Continuous delivery ----> Production deploy


Kernel - interface between hardware
       - it is like adapter between the hardware
       - manage: 
            -> CPU
            -> memory
            ->
