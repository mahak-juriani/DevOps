in 1 region(for ex mumbai) there are for ex 2 buildings and you can choose if you want 1 building or 2.
there are multiple building in a region so that if one building has some problem or it collapses the other building is working fine.

we can select if we want 1 building or 2 or 3 in the region as per our requirement.

there is a vpc(virtual private cloud)
inside vpc there are subnets

inside subnets there are machines, the machines inside the same vpc can talk to each other

the subnets should be connected with a public subnet - igw(internet gateway) so that person from outside aws can talk to the machines.

customer ----> igw ====> Load Balancer ----> private subnet

inside the public subnet(igw) there is a load balancer, which then sends the req to the private subnet.

customer ----> Load Balancer ----> Authentication/Authorization ----> Microservice

DevOps is a set of practices, to deliver applications and services faster more reliably.

Shift Left Approach 
Security Testing
it is good if we find a bug in the initial stages only, or else the cost of finding a bug in the later stage could be very high.

if someone has coded using statement instead of prepared statement, it is vulnerable to injection attack
